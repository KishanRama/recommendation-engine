# recommendation-engine

Simple recommendation engine built for Faber Ventures Challenge.

faber_ventures_challenge.pdf contains the guidelines for this challenge.

solution.pdf contains an explanation for the idea/algorithm used to built this recommendation engine.

To run the project just execute the python file recommendation_engine.py on terminal.
You need to extract the dataset file (http://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Movies.html) in the same directory as recommendation_engine.py

users.txt contains a list of some users id of the dataset. It can be used to test the program.

Because the engine can take considerable time to run when the number of reviews used increases the program is limited to use only around 1 million reviews.
